                        <h2>Silicon Valley Roots</h2>
                        <p>Born and raised in Mountain View, California—the heart of Silicon Valley—I grew up at the intersection of tradition and innovation. While my family ran Casa Lupe, a restaurant started by my grandfather after immigrating from Mexico, I was discovering the world of technology. My first encounter with programming came through LEGO robotics in 5th grade, where block coding opened my eyes to the power of algorithms and problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>This unique blend of entrepreneurial family values and technological exposure shaped my perspective on innovation and hard work. Growing up in a family restaurant taught me the value of dedication and teamwork, while my early experiences with technology sparked a curiosity that would define my future path.</p>

                        <h2>Educational Journey</h2>
                        <p>My passion for programming truly ignited in high school, where I progressed from block coding to mastering Java over four years. As a member of the Popcorn Penguins Team 6238 robotics team, I applied my programming skills to real-world engineering challenges. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I turned isolation into opportunity, using the time to deeply hone my technical abilities.</p>
                        <p>Choosing CSU Chico marked a pivotal decision in my journey—a chance to grow independently while pursuing my passion for computer science. This decision has proven transformative, opening doors to leadership opportunities and a vibrant tech community.</p>

                        <h2>Leadership & Community</h2>
                        <p>Leadership has been a constant thread throughout my journey. From founding my high school's D&D club to serving as trumpet section leader in marching band, I've always sought to create and improve communities. At CSU Chico, this drive led me to the ACM chapter presidency, where I'm working to build a more inclusive and participatory environment for over 300 members.</p>
                        <p>My approach to leadership mirrors my programming philosophy: break down big challenges into manageable steps and never stop iterating on improvements. This mindset has helped me organize successful coding meetings and strengthen our team's performance in the International Collegiate Programming Competition.</p>

                        <h2>Technical Evolution</h2>
                        <p>My technical journey spans from creating simple games in Scratch to developing sophisticated systems like custom assembly interpreters. One of my earliest significant projects was an elevator simulator that tested different optimization algorithms—a perfect blend of practical problem-solving and theoretical computer science.</p>
                        <p>Recent projects like CyberSeagull and LogsDay showcase my growth as a developer and my ability to tackle increasingly complex challenges. Each project represents not just technical achievement, but a story of persistence, problem-solving, and innovation.</p>

                        <h2>Problem-Solving Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>I live by the principle that no problem is too big if broken down properly. This approach—tackling challenges piece by piece while keeping the bigger picture in mind—has served me well in both programming and leadership roles. The thrill of solving complex problems and the joy of innovation drive me forward.</p>
                        <p>My goal is to work in an environment where innovation is constant and collaboration is key. I believe the best solutions come from diverse perspectives and a willingness to tackle challenging problems head-on.</p>

                        <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
                        <p>My curiosity extends far beyond programming. I'm constantly exploring new skills—from leatherworking and sewing to 3D printing—each hobby reinforcing my belief in hands-on learning and creative problem-solving. These diverse interests enhance my approach to technical challenges, bringing fresh perspectives to solution design.</p>
                        <p>My commitment to community service, including work with Ronald McDonald House and Lucille Packard Children's Hospital, reflects my belief in using skills and time to benefit others. This combination of technical expertise, creative exploration, and community service shapes my holistic approach to both technology and leadership.</p>
